There is nothing more valuable during
this life than getting to know your Bible 
and the God who wrote it. The word is a 
guide for your steps…but more. 
Encouragement in hard times…but 
more. Strength for your spiritual 
muscles…but more. It is a chance to 
relate to and hear from the God of the 
Universe! He wants to communicate 
with us, but are we listening?

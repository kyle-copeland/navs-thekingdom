speaker: "Simon Zhang & Kyle Cady"

"All Scripture is breathed out by 
God and profitable for teaching, 
for reproof, for correction, and 
for training in righteousness, 
that the man of God may be 
competent, equipped for every 
good work." (2 Timothy 3:16-17). 
In this workshop we will take a 
look at the purpose behind 
studying scripture, the 
transforming power of God's 
word, as well as, practical ways 
to shepherd others well.

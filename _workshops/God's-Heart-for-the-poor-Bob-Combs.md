title: "God’s Heart for the Poor"
speaker: "Mike Herman"

Why should issues of poverty and justice
be important to Christians? Because 
they are important to God. Did you 
know that the poor, afflicted and 
marginalized are the second most talked 
about subject in the Bible, yet we rarely 
hear sermons about what we as 
believers should be doing to help them. 
When we ignore certain segments of 
society and their need we are preaching 
an incomplete Gospel. Come learn 
about God’s heart for the poor and how 
God wants to use you to bring the full 
Gospel to those in need.

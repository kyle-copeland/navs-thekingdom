If someone asked you, “What has Jesus 
done for you?” would you know what to 
say? This workshop will help us to 
clearly understand the gospel: what 
Jesus did for us, what he still does for 
us, and how that affects us today. This is 
for you if want to begin learning about 
Jesus, if you want to understand the 
gospel better, or if you just want to be 
reminded of everything Jesus has given 
you!

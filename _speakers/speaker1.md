#Testimonies:
"Kyu Ho had a way of making the complicated and elusive nature of the kingdom of God simple enough for anyone, near or far from God, to understand" - Former Student (Alice)

"What I appreciate about Kyu Ho is how much time he spends studying, praying through, and practicing what he teaches on. He embodies Ezra 7:10 (ESV) - For Ezra had set his heart ot study the Law of the LORD, and to do it and teach his statutes and rules in Isreal." This type of life produces deep insights. - Former Student (Carlos)

"Kyu Ho loves God and loves people. He has helped me see the freedom I have in Jesus, and how attainable and beatiful it is to love the way Jesus intended." - Navs 20s (Kyle)
